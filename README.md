# 🕹️ Tic Tac Toe Game with Java

I built this project as part of my journey to mastering Java fundamentals through practical and interactive programs. The Tic Tac Toe game is a console-based application that allows two players to challenge each other in a classic game of strategy and wit. This project gave me the opportunity to apply essential programming concepts while developing an engaging and interactive game.

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project is a part of my hands-on Java learning experience and focuses on implementing core programming concepts such as conditional statements, loops, arrays, and user input handling. The game offers a simple, yet robust, implementation of Tic Tac Toe where players take turns marking spaces on a 3×3 grid until one wins or the game ends in a draw.

## 🎯 What I Learned  
- 🏗️ Basics of Java programming  
- 🔄 Effective use of loops for game flow control 
- 🎮 Implementing game logic and state management
- 🔢 Utilizing arrays to represent the game board
- 💬 Handling user input and validating moves

## 🔧 Features  
- ✅ Interactive console-based gameplay
- ✅ Two-player mode with alternating turns
- ✅ Input validation to ensure legal moves
- ✅ Real-time game state updates after each move
- ✅ Clear win/draw detection and game reset functionality

## 📂 Project Structure  
The project was developed in incremental stages, enhancing functionality at each step:

- Game Board Initialization: Sets up an empty 3×3 board.
- Player Input: Reads and validates moves from both players.
-Game Logic: Determines the game's state (win, draw, or continue).
- User Feedback: Displays the board after each move and announces the result.
